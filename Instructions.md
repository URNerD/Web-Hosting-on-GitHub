# Setting up web hosting with GitHub Pages

One of the cool features of GitHub is that you can set up a web site using GitHub Pages. Besides making your web pages available to the world, putting your pages on a web server (as opposed to viewing them directly in a browser) makes it possible to use features like Javascript.

# Instructions

1. Enable web hosting on GitHub by following the instructions here: [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Follow the instructions for a "User or organization site."
2. While you are waiting for GitHub to publish your page, modify the index.html file that you created and make it "properly formed" HTML. For now this means using the tags demonstrated in the HTML tutorials – especially the ```<DOCTYPE>```, ```<html>```, ```<head>```, ```<title>```, and ```<body>``` tags.
3. When you think you've got it, commit and push your changes to GitHub and check out your page.
4. Finally check to see if you've got your HTML right. There are a number of sites that will check your HTML (you can find them by searching on terms like "HTML validation" or "HTML syntax check." The [W3C Validator Service ](http://validator.w3.org/) is one and it does a nice job.
5. Correct any errors that you find, then commit and push the final version.
